# web-competition-business-website
This is a dynamic website that I have created during a web development competition, I made it using technologies php,css,html,sql,mysql,javascript. <br />
The concept of the competition is to code a website using html and css in 2 hours. <br />
It's a website for a Business company that provide spaces for teams work  and new technologies such as VR, 3d printing and more for everyone to learn .<br />
In this website, I made the design and and logic from scratch, I managed to make the design for the site and a login system. <br />
I hosted the site on heroku if you want to take a look, link below: <br /><br/>
